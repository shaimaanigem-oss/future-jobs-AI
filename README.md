# AI-Powered Future Careers (AI Course Project)

A one-page website project for the **AI** course exploring how Artificial Intelligence can support future careers, what may change over time, and which human skills remain essential. The project also demonstrates how **prompt design** and adding **constraints** can reduce bias and improve output diversity.
